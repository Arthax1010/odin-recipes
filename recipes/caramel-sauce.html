        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>6oz of solid butter</li>
            <li>1 cup of heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 cups of white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of water</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water and sugar in a small saucepot. Put on <em>very</em> low 
            heat and let the sugar dissolve fully, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>While you wait on the sugar, set out your butter and heavy cream so that 
                they become room temperature. I recommend cutting the butter into small cubes.
            </li>
            <li>Once the sugar has dissolved, turn the heat up until you get a low simmer.
                The slower you go here the better. At this stage I like to keep a small pastry
                brush and a bit of water on hand so that I can dissolve any sugar crystals 
                that may form on the side of the pot.
            </li>
            <li>Keep simmering until your mixture is a dark amber color.</li>
            <li><strong><em>Carefully</em></strong> add your butter to the mixture. Beware of 
            splashing. Molten sugar is not a joke.</li>
            <li>Once the butter has been fully incorporated into the mixture, add your heavy 
                cream and return to a low simmer.</li>
            <li>Once a simmer is achieved, add your salt and stir thoroughly to make sure it 
                dissolves.</li>
        </ol>
