        <h3>A smooth classic with a tiny bourbon kick!</h3>
        
        <p>I learned this one from an old coworker of mine. He always had a sweet tooth
            and so any time I needed some inspiration for a dessert I'd ask him. This 
            recipe is one of my favorites that he has shown me.

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>12oz white chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1 cup of heavy cream</li>
            <li>2oz of your favorite bourbon</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add chocolate chips to a small saucepot.</li>
            <li>How much cream you add is entirely up to you. I like my sauce just a little 
                bit thick so I dont add much cream. If you like your sauce thinner then it 
                won't hurt to add extra cream here.
            </li>
            <li>Put on low heat and try not to simmer. You aren't cooking anything here. 
                You are just melting the chocolate into the cream.
            </li>
            <li>Once the chocolate is fully melted, add your bourbon.</li>
        </ol>
